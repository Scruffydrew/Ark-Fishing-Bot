# Ark-Fishing-Bot
**The only way to stop the program is to either close the console or to end it in task manager**

To use the program follow the following steps:

Step 1:

  Run the program and click back into Ark.

Step 2:

  Cast your rod and wait
  **The program will not cast the rod for you, so you will have to do that yourself**

  **At all times you must be clicked into Ark otherwise the program will not work as it just simulates keyboard presses to create a sort of macro that is able to make decisions on what it should do based on what it can see on your screen**

  After clicking on More info the pop-up will look something similar to the above image, just may be a different colour depending on your what you have your colours set to in your settings.

  Just click on the button labeled Run anyway, this will run the program.
  **You will only need to do this for the first time you run the program**
